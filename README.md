# GANimorph_pytorch
Implementation of the GANimorph GAN described in the paper titled "Improving Shape Deformation in Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation"(https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04325)

This notebook was used to train the model specifically on the cat_dog_face dataset to translate cat images to dog images. 

Requirements
- PyTorch
- PIL

To train on cat_dog_face, download the dataset and save it in the same directory as the notebook.
